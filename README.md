# data-project

## This data project gathers information on what a living wage should be for individuals living in Orlando, FL in an effort to help determine what career path an individual mentee should take on sweettrades.org. Below are the resources currently being gathered:

* [MIT Living Wage Calculator, Florida](https://livingwage.mit.edu/states/12)
* (MIT Living Wage Calculator, Orange County, Florida)[https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/12095]

The MIT resources above should be used to formulate a survey for users of sweettrades.org


## Defining "living wage"

* Basic Needs: The MIT Living Wage Calculator estimates a living wage for a single person in Orlando with no children to be around $46,645 before taxes [1]. This covers basic necessities like groceries, a modest apartment, healthcare, and transportation.
* Comfortable Living: A recent study suggests a higher threshold for living comfortably in Orlando. That study says a single person would need to make $67,740 after taxes to afford a comfortable lifestyle which includes some flexibility for spending beyond basic needs [2].

## Other factors to consider:

* Family Size: The cost of living increases significantly with a family. MIT’s calculator can help estimate the living wage for different family sizes [5].
* Debt: If you have student loans or other debts, you’ll need to factor those into your budget.
* Lifestyle: Your definition of “comfortable” may vary. If you enjoy eating out or going to theme parks often, you'll need to make more than the base living wage.

Overall, a living wage in Orlando can range from around $46,645 for basic needs to $67,740 or more for a comfortable lifestyle. We'll need to help the user find the wage that will meet their individual needs, and suggest career paths based on those needs.
