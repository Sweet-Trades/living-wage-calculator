# Sweet Trades Living Wage Calculator

## Defining "living wage"

* Basic Needs: The MIT Living Wage Calculator estimates a living wage for a single person in Orlando with no children to be around $46,645 before taxes. This covers basic necessities like groceries, a modest apartment, healthcare, and transportation.
* Comfortable Living: A single person would need to make $67,740 after taxes to afford a comfortable lifestyle which includes some flexibility for spending beyond basic needs.

## Other factors to consider:

* Family Size: The cost of living increases significantly with a family. MIT’s calculator can help estimate the living wage for different family size.
* Debt: If you have student loans or other debts, you’ll need to factor those into your budget.
* Lifestyle: Your definition of “comfortable” may vary. If you enjoy eating out or going to theme parks often, you'll need to make more than the base living wage.

Overall, a living wage in Orlando can range from around $46,645 for basic needs to $67,740 or more for a comfortable lifestyle. We'll need to help the user find the wage that will meet their individual needs, and suggest career paths based on those needs.
